# GCP Metrics Exporter for GitHub Actions

A GitHub Action that collects workflow step metrics and traces, and exports them to Google Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Trace.

## Features

- 📊 **Metrics**: Duration histograms and success/failure counters for jobs and steps
- 🔍 **Traces**: Distributed traces showing job and step execution timeline with parent-child relationships
- 🏷️ Rich attributes and labels (workflow, job, repository, run info, step attribution)
- 🔒 Minimal permissions (only metric writer and trace agent)
- 🔄 Always runs (even when steps fail)

## Setup

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Service Account

Create a service account with minimal permissions to write metrics and traces:

```bash
# Set your GCP project ID
PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"

# Create the service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create gcp-metrics-action \
  --display-name="GCP Metrics Exporter for GitHub Actions" \
  --description="Service account for GitHub Actions to export metrics and traces" \
  --project="${PROJECT_ID}"

# Grant required roles
SA_EMAIL="gcp-metrics-action@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# For metrics
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
  --role="roles/monitoring.metricWriter" \
  --condition=None

# For traces
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
  --role="roles/cloudtrace.agent" \
  --condition=None

# Create and download a JSON key
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create github-actions-metrics-key.json \
  --iam-account="${SA_EMAIL}"
```

**Roles explained:**
- `roles/monitoring.metricWriter` - Write custom metrics to Cloud Monitoring
- `roles/cloudtrace.agent` - Write traces to Cloud Trace

### 2. Add Service Account Key to GitHub

You have two options:

**Option A: Use GitHub Secrets (Recommended for production)**

1. Copy the contents of the JSON key file:
   ```bash
   cat github-actions-metrics-key.json
   ```

2. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

3. Click **New repository secret**

4. Name: `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` (or whatever you want)

5. Value: Paste the entire JSON content

6. Click **Add secret**

8. **Securely delete the key file:**
   ```bash
   rm github-actions-metrics-key.json
   ```

**Option B: Commit the key file (For private repos only)**

You can commit the key file directly:

```bash
git add github-actions-metrics-key.json
git commit -m "Add service account key for metrics"
git push
```

**⚠️ Security Requirements:**
- **MUST** be a private repository (action will refuse to run this way in public repos)
- **Warning:** For production security or public repos, use GitHub Secrets or Workload Identity Federation instead

The action includes built-in security checks:
- ✓ Refuses to run if repository is public (checked via GitHub API)
- ✓ **Best-effort:** Verifies service account has minimal roles
- ✓ Errors if excessive permissions are detected

This is mainly intended to be used in `pull_request` workflows where secrets and workload identity federation are not available.

**Service Account Permission Validation:**

The action attempts to call the GCP IAM API to verify that the service account has only minimal required permissions (`roles/monitoring.metricWriter`).

**Important:** This check requires the service account to have `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy` permission, which is **not** included in `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`. Therefore:

- ✅ **If successful:** Will error and refuse to run if excessive permissions are detected
- ⚠️ **If unsuccessful:** Will log an info message and proceed (this is expected with minimal permissions)

**To enable the permission check** (optional, adds minimal permissions):

```bash
# Create a custom role with only the getIamPolicy permission
gcloud iam roles create githubActionsMetricsChecker \
  --project=jason-chainguard \
  --title="GitHub Actions Metrics Permission Checker" \
  --permissions=resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy

# Grant it to the service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding jason-chainguard \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-actions-metrics@jason-chainguard.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="projects/jason-chainguard/roles/githubActionsMetricsChecker" \
  --condition=None
```

With this optional permission, the action can verify it has no excessive roles and provide specific remediation commands if issues are found.

## Usage

### Authentication Methods

This action supports two authentication methods:

| Method | Best For | Works With | Setup Complexity |
|--------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Service Account Key File** | Private repos, weaker security | `pull_request` only | Simplest - only supported for private repos |
| **Service Account Key File (Secret)** | Production, good security | `push`, `pull_request_target` only | Simple - just create and store a key |
| **Workload Identity Federation** | Production, best security | `push`, `pull_request_target` only | Moderate - requires WIF setup |

**Quick Decision:**
- Using `pull_request` from private forks? → **You can use Service Account Key File**
- Production workflows on `push`? → **Use GitHub Secret or Workload Identity Federation**

### Basic Usage (with Committed Key File)

For private repositories, you can commit the key file:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: imjasonh/gcp-metrics-action@...
    with:
      github-token: ${{ github.token }}
      gcp-service-account-key-file: github-actions-metrics-key.json
  # Your workflow steps...
```

### Project ID Auto-Detection

The action automatically detects the GCP project ID in this order:

1. **Explicit input**: `gcp-project-id` parameter
2. **Service account key file**: Extracted from `project_id` field in the JSON key
3. **Environment variable**: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GCLOUD_PROJECT`, or `GCP_PROJECT`
4. **Application Default Credentials**: Detected from ADC configuration

For most use cases, you don't need to specify `gcp-project-id` explicitly.

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
- uses: imjasonh/gcp-metrics-action@...
  with:
    github-token: ${{ github.token }}
    gcp-service-account-key-file: github-actions-metrics-key.json

    # Optional: Override project ID (auto-detected in most cases)
    # gcp-project-id: 'my-project-id'

    # Optional: Customize service name for resource attributes
    service-name: 'my-app-ci'

    # Optional: Customize service namespace
    service-namespace: 'production'

    # Optional: Customize metric name prefix
    metric-prefix: 'ci.metrics'
```

- Correlate metrics with traces for deeper insights

## Advanced: Creating Custom Trace Spans

The action exports the root trace context so your workflow steps can create child spans:

### Using the Trace Context

The action sets the `TRACEPARENT` environment variable (W3C Trace Context format) that subsequent steps can use:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: imjasonh/gcp-metrics-action@...
    id: gcp-metrics
    with:
      github-token: ${{ github.token }}

  # TRACEPARENT is now available in environment
  # Your application can use it to create child spans

  - name: Your instrumented step
    run: |
      # The TRACEPARENT env var is automatically set
      echo "Trace context: $TRACEPARENT"
      echo "Span ID: ${{ steps.gcp-metrics.outputs.span-id }}"
      # Your app can use this to create child spans under the job span
```

### Available Outputs

- `traceparent` - W3C Trace Context header value (use this for most instrumentation)
- `trace-id` - OpenTelemetry Trace ID (32-character hex string)
- `span-id` - Root span ID for this job (16-character hex string)

### Example: Node.js App with OpenTelemetry

```yaml
- uses: ./
  with:
    github-token: ${{ github.token }}
    gcp-service-account-key-file: key.json

- name: Run instrumented app
  env:
    # TRACEPARENT already set automatically
    OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: https://your-collector:4318
  run: |
    # Your app reads TRACEPARENT and creates child spans
    node my-app.js
```

Your application can use standard OpenTelemetry libraries to read `TRACEPARENT` and create child spans that will appear under the job span in Cloud Trace.

## Alternative: Using Workload Identity Federation (Recommended)

Instead of service account keys, you can use Workload Identity Federation (WIF). This is the **recommended** approach for production as it doesn't require managing service account key files.

### Important: Workflow Event Limitations

⚠️ **WIF requires `id-token: write` permission, which is only available for:**
- `push` events
- `pull_request_target` events (runs in the context of the target repo)

❌ **WIF will NOT work with:**
- `pull_request` events (runs in the context of the fork, cannot get OIDC tokens)

For pull requests from forks, you must use service account keys instead.

### WIF Configuration

```yaml
name: CI with WIF

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request_target:  # Use pull_request_target, not pull_request
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write  # Required for WIF
      actions: read    # Required to read workflow/job info

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Authenticate with GCP first
      - name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v3
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: ${{ secrets.WIF_PROVIDER }}
          service_account: ${{ secrets.WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}

      # Setup metrics collection
      - uses: imjasonh/gcp-metrics-action@...
        with:
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
          # gcp-project-id is auto-detected from ADC
          # gcp-service-account-key-file is omitted - uses ADC from WIF

      # Your workflow steps...
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

### Setting Up Workload Identity Federation

1. Create a Workload Identity Pool and Provider in GCP
2. Grant the service account permissions to the pool
3. Add secrets to GitHub:
   - `WIF_PROVIDER`: Full resource name of the workload identity provider
   - `WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: Email of the service account
   - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your GCP project ID

See [Google's documentation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#workload-identity-federation) for detailed setup instructions.

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Build

The action uses [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to compile the JavaScript and dependencies into a single file for distribution.

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates:
- `dist/index.js` - Main entry point
- `dist/post/index.js` - Post-action with all dependencies

**Important:** The `dist/` directory must be committed for the action to work in GitHub Actions.

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run tests and build before each commit.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
brew install pre-commit  # macOS
# or: pip install pre-commit  # other platforms

# Install the git hook scripts
pre-commit install
```

Now `npm test` and `npm run build` will run automatically before each commit. If either fails, the commit will be aborted.

**Manual execution:**

```bash
# Run hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```
