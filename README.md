# OpenTelemetry Exporter for GitHub Actions

A GitHub Action that collects workflow step metrics, traces, and logs, and exports them to Google Cloud Observability (Monitoring, Trace, and Logging).

## Features

- 📊 **Metrics**: Duration histograms and success/failure counters for jobs and steps
- 🔍 **Traces**: Distributed traces showing job and step execution timeline with parent-child relationships
- 📝 **Logs**: Complete workflow output (stdout/stderr) with **original timestamps** from when each line was emitted
- ⏱️ Accurate timing - all data (metrics, traces, logs) uses actual execution timestamps, not post-action time
- ✅ Automatic error detection (failed steps marked as errors in traces/logs)
- 🏷️ Rich attributes and labels (workflow, job, repository, run info, step attribution)
- 🔒 Minimal permissions (only metric writer, trace agent, log writer)
- 🔄 Always runs (even when steps fail)

## Setup

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Service Account

Create a service account with minimal permissions to write metrics and traces:

```bash
# Set your GCP project ID
PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"

# Create the service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create github-actions-otel \
  --display-name="GitHub Actions OpenTelemetry" \
  --description="Service account for GitHub Actions to export OpenTelemetry metrics and traces" \
  --project="${PROJECT_ID}"

# Grant required roles
SA_EMAIL="github-actions-otel@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# For metrics
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
  --role="roles/monitoring.metricWriter" \
  --condition=None

# For traces
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
  --role="roles/cloudtrace.agent" \
  --condition=None

# For logs
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
  --role="roles/logging.logWriter" \
  --condition=None

# Create and download a JSON key
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create github-actions-otel-key.json \
  --iam-account="${SA_EMAIL}"
```

**Roles explained:**
- `roles/monitoring.metricWriter` - Write custom metrics to Cloud Monitoring
- `roles/cloudtrace.agent` - Write traces to Cloud Trace
- `roles/logging.logWriter` - Write logs to Cloud Logging

### 2. Add Service Account Key to GitHub

You have two options:

**Option A: Use GitHub Secrets (Recommended for production)**

1. Copy the contents of the JSON key file:
   ```bash
   cat github-actions-metrics-key.json
   ```

2. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

3. Click **New repository secret**

4. Name: `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`

5. Value: Paste the entire JSON content

6. Click **Add secret**

7. Also add your GCP project ID as a secret:
   - Name: `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
   - Value: Your project ID (e.g., `jason-chainguard`)

8. **Securely delete the key file:**
   ```bash
   rm github-actions-metrics-key.json
   ```

**Option B: Commit the key file (For private repos only)**

You can commit the key file directly:

```bash
git add github-actions-metrics-key.json
git commit -m "Add service account key for metrics"
git push
```

**⚠️ Security Requirements:**
- **MUST** be a private repository (action will refuse to run in public repos)
- **Warning:** For production, use GitHub Secrets or Workload Identity Federation instead

The action includes built-in security checks:
- ✓ Refuses to run if repository is public (checked via GitHub API)
- ✓ **Best-effort:** Verifies service account has ONLY `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`
- ✓ Errors if excessive permissions are detected

This is mainly intended to be used in `pull_request` workflows where secrets and workload identity federation are not available.

**Service Account Permission Validation:**

The action attempts to call the GCP IAM API to verify that the service account has only minimal required permissions (`roles/monitoring.metricWriter`).

**Important:** This check requires the service account to have `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy` permission, which is **not** included in `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`. Therefore:

- ✅ **If successful:** Will error and refuse to run if excessive permissions are detected
- ⚠️ **If unsuccessful:** Will log an info message and proceed (this is expected with minimal permissions)

**To enable the permission check** (optional, adds minimal permissions):

```bash
# Create a custom role with only the getIamPolicy permission
gcloud iam roles create githubActionsMetricsChecker \
  --project=jason-chainguard \
  --title="GitHub Actions Metrics Permission Checker" \
  --permissions=resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy

# Grant it to the service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding jason-chainguard \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-actions-metrics@jason-chainguard.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="projects/jason-chainguard/roles/githubActionsMetricsChecker" \
  --condition=None
```

With this optional permission, the action can verify it has no excessive roles and provide specific remediation commands if issues are found.

## Usage

### Authentication Methods

This action supports two authentication methods:

| Method | Best For | Works With | Setup Complexity |
|--------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Service Account Key File** | Testing, forks, `pull_request` events | All workflow events | Simple - just create and store a key |
| **Workload Identity Federation** | Production, security-conscious | `push`, `pull_request_target` only | Moderate - requires WIF setup |

**Quick Decision:**
- Using `pull_request` from forks? → **Use Service Account Key File**
- Production workflows on `push`? → **Use Workload Identity Federation**

### Basic Usage (with Service Account Key File)

Add the action as one of the first steps in your workflow. The action will automatically collect metrics in a post-action phase after all other steps complete.

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout first
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Write secret to file
      - name: Setup GCP credentials
        run: echo '${{ secrets.GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}' > /tmp/gcp-key.json

      # Enable metrics collection
      - name: Setup OpenTelemetry Metrics
        uses: your-org/otel-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          gcp-service-account-key-file: /tmp/gcp-key.json
          # gcp-project-id is automatically extracted from the service account key
          # You can override it explicitly if needed: gcp-project-id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}

      # Your regular workflow steps
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      # Metrics are automatically collected and exported after this job completes
```

### Alternative: Using Committed Key File

If you have the key file committed (for testing):

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: your-org/otel-action@v1
    with:
      github-token: ${{ github.token }}
      gcp-service-account-key-file: github-actions-metrics-key.json
      # gcp-project-id is automatically extracted from the key file

  # Your workflow steps...
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
- name: Setup OpenTelemetry Metrics
  uses: your-org/otel-action@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    gcp-service-account-key-file: /tmp/gcp-key.json

    # Optional: Override project ID (defaults to project from service account key)
    # gcp-project-id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}

    # Optional: Customize service name for resource attributes
    service-name: 'my-app-ci'

    # Optional: Customize service namespace
    service-namespace: 'production'

    # Optional: Customize metric name prefix
    metric-prefix: 'ci.metrics'
```

## Data Collected

- **Type:** Histogram
- **Unit:** milliseconds
- **Labels:**
  - `workflow.name` - Name of the workflow
  - `job.name` - Name of the job
  - `job.status` - Status (completed, in_progress, etc.)
  - `job.conclusion` - Conclusion (success, failure, cancelled, etc.)
  - `repository.owner` - Repository owner
  - `repository.name` - Repository name
  - `repository.full_name` - Full repository name (owner/repo)
  - `run.id` - Workflow run ID

- **Labels:** All job labels plus:
  - `step.name` - Name of the step
  - `step.number` - Step number
  - `step.status` - Status (completed, in_progress, etc.)
  - `step.conclusion` - Conclusion (success, failure, skipped, etc.)

#### Step Count
- **Metric:** `github.actions.step.total`
- **Type:** Counter
- **Labels:** Same as step duration

### Traces

The action creates distributed traces showing the execution timeline of your workflow:

- **Job Span**: Root span covering the entire job execution
  - Span name: `Job: {job-name}`
  - Includes all job attributes (workflow, repository, run info, job status/conclusion)
  - Marked as error if job fails

- **Step Spans**: Child spans for each workflow step
  - Span name: `Step: {step-name}`
  - Parent: Job span (creates hierarchical trace)
  - Includes all step attributes (name, number, status, conclusion)
  - Marked as error if step fails
  - Accurate start/end times from GitHub API

**Benefits:**
- Visualize workflow execution in Cloud Trace timeline view
- Identify slow steps at a glance
- See step dependencies and parallelization
- Correlate failures across steps
- Track execution patterns over time

## Viewing Data

### Viewing Metrics

Metrics will appear in Google Cloud Monitoring under custom metrics:

1. Go to **Cloud Console → Monitoring → Metrics Explorer**
2. Search for: `custom.googleapis.com/github.actions`
3. Available metrics:
   - `custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/job.duration`
   - `custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/step.duration`
   - `custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/step.total`

### Example Queries

**Average step duration by step name:**
```
custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/step.duration
| filter resource.project_id = "your-project-id"
| group_by [metric.step.name]
| mean
```

**Job failure rate:**
```
custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/step.total
| filter metric.step.conclusion = "failure"
| rate(1m)
```

### Viewing Traces

Traces will appear in Google Cloud Trace:

1. Go to **Cloud Console → Trace → Trace Explorer**
2. You'll see traces for each workflow job execution
3. Click on a trace to see the timeline:
   - Job span showing total execution time
   - Step spans showing individual step durations
   - Failed steps highlighted in red
   - Hover over spans to see attributes (workflow name, repository, etc.)

**Trace URL format:**
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/traces/list?project=your-project-id
```

**Benefits of the trace view:**
- See all steps in a single timeline
- Identify bottlenecks visually
- Understand step execution order
- Correlate metrics with traces for deeper insights

### Logs

The action captures and writes **detailed workflow logs** to Google Cloud Logging:

**What gets logged:**
- Every line of output from your workflow job (stdout/stderr)
- Each log line includes its **original timestamp** from when it was emitted
- Automatic severity detection (ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG, INFO)
- Step attribution (which step generated each log line)

**Log entries include:**
- **Timestamp**: Original time when the log line was emitted during the job (not post-action time!)
- **Message**: The actual log output from the step
- **Severity**: Auto-detected from log content (::error::, ::warning::, ERROR, WARNING)
- **Labels**: workflow, repository, run info, job name, step name
- **Resource type**: `generic_task`

**Fallback:** If detailed logs cannot be fetched, writes summary entries for each job and step.

**Log name:** `github-actions`

**Viewing logs:**
1. Go to **Cloud Console → Logging → Logs Explorer**
2. Query: `logName="projects/your-project-id/logs/github-actions"`
3. Filter by repository, workflow, job, or step using labels

**Example queries:**

View all logs from a specific run:
```
logName="projects/your-project-id/logs/github-actions"
labels.run_number="42"
```

Find errors during the workflow:
```
logName="projects/your-project-id/logs/github-actions"
severity=ERROR
```

View logs for a specific step:
```
logName="projects/your-project-id/logs/github-actions"
labels.step="npm test"
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete workflow output preserved with accurate timestamps
- Search and filter logs by step, workflow, repository
- Correlate log errors with trace spans and metrics
- Historical log retention in Cloud Logging (not just GitHub's 90 days)

## Alternative: Using Workload Identity Federation (Recommended)

Instead of service account keys, you can use Workload Identity Federation (WIF). This is the **recommended** approach for production as it doesn't require managing service account key files.

### Important: Workflow Event Limitations

⚠️ **WIF requires `id-token: write` permission, which is only available for:**
- `push` events
- `pull_request_target` events (runs in the context of the target repo)

❌ **WIF will NOT work with:**
- `pull_request` events (runs in the context of the fork, cannot get OIDC tokens)

For pull requests from forks, you must use service account keys instead.

### WIF Configuration

```yaml
name: CI with WIF

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request_target:  # Use pull_request_target, not pull_request
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write  # Required for WIF
      actions: read    # Required to read workflow/job info

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Authenticate with GCP first
      - name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: ${{ secrets.WIF_PROVIDER }}
          service_account: ${{ secrets.WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}

      # Setup metrics collection (no key file needed)
      - uses: your-org/otel-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
          gcp-project-id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
          # gcp-service-account-key-file is omitted - uses ADC from WIF

      # Your workflow steps...
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

### Setting Up Workload Identity Federation

1. Create a Workload Identity Pool and Provider in GCP
2. Grant the service account permissions to the pool
3. Add secrets to GitHub:
   - `WIF_PROVIDER`: Full resource name of the workload identity provider
   - `WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: Email of the service account
   - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your GCP project ID

See [Google's documentation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#workload-identity-federation) for detailed setup instructions.

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Build

The action uses [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to compile the JavaScript and dependencies into a single file for distribution.

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates:
- `dist/index.js` - Main entry point
- `dist/post/index.js` - Post-action with all dependencies

**Important:** The `dist/` directory must be committed for the action to work in GitHub Actions.

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run tests and build before each commit.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
brew install pre-commit  # macOS
# or: pip install pre-commit  # other platforms

# Install the git hook scripts
pre-commit install
```

Now `npm test` and `npm run build` will run automatically before each commit. If either fails, the commit will be aborted.

**Manual execution:**

```bash
# Run hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```
