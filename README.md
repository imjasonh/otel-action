# OpenTelemetry Metrics Exporter for GitHub Actions

A GitHub Action that collects workflow step metrics (duration, status) and exports them to Google Cloud Monitoring via OpenTelemetry.

## Features

- 📊 Collects job and step-level metrics from GitHub Actions workflows
- ⏱️ Records duration histograms for performance tracking
- ✅ Tracks success/failure rates with counters
- 🏷️ Rich metric labels (workflow, job, repository, run info)
- 🔒 Minimal permissions (Monitoring Metric Writer only)
- 🔄 Always runs (even when steps fail)

## Setup

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Service Account

Create a service account with only the permission to write metrics:

```bash
# Set your GCP project ID
PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"

# Create the service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create github-actions-metrics \
  --display-name="GitHub Actions OpenTelemetry Metrics" \
  --description="Service account for GitHub Actions to write OpenTelemetry metrics to Cloud Monitoring" \
  --project="${PROJECT_ID}"

# Grant the Monitoring Metric Writer role
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-actions-metrics@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/monitoring.metricWriter" \
  --condition=None

# Create and download a JSON key
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create github-actions-metrics-key.json \
  --iam-account="github-actions-metrics@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

### 2. Add Service Account Key to GitHub

You have two options:

**Option A: Use GitHub Secrets (Recommended for production)**

1. Copy the contents of the JSON key file:
   ```bash
   cat github-actions-metrics-key.json
   ```

2. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

3. Click **New repository secret**

4. Name: `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`

5. Value: Paste the entire JSON content

6. Click **Add secret**

7. Also add your GCP project ID as a secret:
   - Name: `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
   - Value: Your project ID (e.g., `jason-chainguard`)

8. **Securely delete the key file:**
   ```bash
   rm github-actions-metrics-key.json
   ```

**Option B: Commit the key file (For private repos only)**

You can commit the key file directly:

```bash
git add github-actions-metrics-key.json
git commit -m "Add service account key for metrics"
git push
```

**⚠️ Security Requirements:**
- **MUST** be a private repository (action will refuse to run in public repos)
- **Warning:** For production, use GitHub Secrets or Workload Identity Federation instead

The action includes built-in security checks:
- ✓ Refuses to run if repository is public (checked via GitHub API)
- ✓ **Best-effort:** Verifies service account has ONLY `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`
- ✓ Errors if excessive permissions are detected

This is mainly intended to be used in `pull_request` workflows where secrets and workload identity federation are not available.

**Service Account Permission Validation:**

The action attempts to call the GCP IAM API to verify that the service account has only minimal required permissions (`roles/monitoring.metricWriter`).

**Important:** This check requires the service account to have `resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy` permission, which is **not** included in `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`. Therefore:

- ✅ **If successful:** Will error and refuse to run if excessive permissions are detected
- ⚠️ **If unsuccessful:** Will log an info message and proceed (this is expected with minimal permissions)

**To enable the permission check** (optional, adds minimal permissions):

```bash
# Create a custom role with only the getIamPolicy permission
gcloud iam roles create githubActionsMetricsChecker \
  --project=jason-chainguard \
  --title="GitHub Actions Metrics Permission Checker" \
  --permissions=resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy

# Grant it to the service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding jason-chainguard \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-actions-metrics@jason-chainguard.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="projects/jason-chainguard/roles/githubActionsMetricsChecker" \
  --condition=None
```

With this optional permission, the action can verify it has no excessive roles and provide specific remediation commands if issues are found.

## Usage

### Authentication Methods

This action supports two authentication methods:

| Method | Best For | Works With | Setup Complexity |
|--------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Service Account Key File** | Testing, forks, `pull_request` events | All workflow events | Simple - just create and store a key |
| **Workload Identity Federation** | Production, security-conscious | `push`, `pull_request_target` only | Moderate - requires WIF setup |

**Quick Decision:**
- Using `pull_request` from forks? → **Use Service Account Key File**
- Production workflows on `push`? → **Use Workload Identity Federation**

### Basic Usage (with Service Account Key File)

Add the action as one of the first steps in your workflow. The action will automatically collect metrics in a post-action phase after all other steps complete.

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checkout first
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Write secret to file
      - name: Setup GCP credentials
        run: echo '${{ secrets.GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}' > /tmp/gcp-key.json

      # Enable metrics collection
      - name: Setup OpenTelemetry Metrics
        uses: your-org/otel-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          gcp-service-account-key-file: /tmp/gcp-key.json
          # gcp-project-id is automatically extracted from the service account key
          # You can override it explicitly if needed: gcp-project-id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}

      # Your regular workflow steps
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      # Metrics are automatically collected and exported after this job completes
```

### Alternative: Using Committed Key File

If you have the key file committed (for testing):

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: your-org/otel-action@v1
    with:
      github-token: ${{ github.token }}
      gcp-service-account-key-file: github-actions-metrics-key.json
      # gcp-project-id is automatically extracted from the key file

  # Your workflow steps...
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
- name: Setup OpenTelemetry Metrics
  uses: your-org/otel-action@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    gcp-service-account-key-file: /tmp/gcp-key.json

    # Optional: Override project ID (defaults to project from service account key)
    # gcp-project-id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}

    # Optional: Customize service name for resource attributes
    service-name: 'my-app-ci'

    # Optional: Customize service namespace
    service-namespace: 'production'

    # Optional: Customize metric name prefix
    metric-prefix: 'ci.metrics'
```

## Metrics Collected

### Job Duration
- **Metric:** `github.actions.job.duration`
- **Type:** Histogram
- **Unit:** milliseconds
- **Labels:**
  - `workflow.name` - Name of the workflow
  - `job.name` - Name of the job
  - `job.status` - Status (completed, in_progress, etc.)
  - `job.conclusion` - Conclusion (success, failure, cancelled, etc.)
  - `repository.owner` - Repository owner
  - `repository.name` - Repository name
  - `repository.full_name` - Full repository name (owner/repo)
  - `run.id` - Workflow run ID
  - `run.number` - Workflow run number
  - `run.attempt` - Run attempt number

### Step Duration
- **Metric:** `github.actions.step.duration`
- **Type:** Histogram
- **Unit:** milliseconds
- **Labels:** All job labels plus:
  - `step.name` - Name of the step
  - `step.number` - Step number
  - `step.status` - Status (completed, in_progress, etc.)
  - `step.conclusion` - Conclusion (success, failure, skipped, etc.)

### Step Count
- **Metric:** `github.actions.step.total`
- **Type:** Counter
- **Labels:** Same as step duration

## Viewing Metrics

Metrics will appear in Google Cloud Monitoring under custom metrics:

1. Go to **Cloud Console → Monitoring → Metrics Explorer**
2. Search for: `custom.googleapis.com/github.actions`
3. Available metrics:
   - `custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/job.duration`
   - `custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/step.duration`
   - `custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/step.total`

### Example Queries

**Average step duration by step name:**
```
custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/step.duration
| filter resource.project_id = "your-project-id"
| group_by [metric.step.name]
| mean
```

**Job failure rate:**
```
custom.googleapis.com/github.actions/step.total
| filter metric.step.conclusion = "failure"
| rate(1m)
```

## Alternative: Using Workload Identity Federation (Recommended)

Instead of service account keys, you can use Workload Identity Federation (WIF). This is the **recommended** approach for production as it doesn't require managing service account key files.

### Important: Workflow Event Limitations

⚠️ **WIF requires `id-token: write` permission, which is only available for:**
- `push` events
- `pull_request_target` events (runs in the context of the target repo)

❌ **WIF will NOT work with:**
- `pull_request` events (runs in the context of the fork, cannot get OIDC tokens)

For pull requests from forks, you must use service account keys instead.

### WIF Configuration

```yaml
name: CI with WIF

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request_target:  # Use pull_request_target, not pull_request
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write  # Required for WIF
      actions: read    # Required to read workflow/job info

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Authenticate with GCP first
      - name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: ${{ secrets.WIF_PROVIDER }}
          service_account: ${{ secrets.WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}

      # Setup metrics collection (no key file needed)
      - uses: your-org/otel-action@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
          gcp-project-id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
          # gcp-service-account-key-file is omitted - uses ADC from WIF

      # Your workflow steps...
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

### Setting Up Workload Identity Federation

1. Create a Workload Identity Pool and Provider in GCP
2. Grant the service account permissions to the pool
3. Add secrets to GitHub:
   - `WIF_PROVIDER`: Full resource name of the workload identity provider
   - `WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: Email of the service account
   - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your GCP project ID

See [Google's documentation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#workload-identity-federation) for detailed setup instructions.

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Build

The action uses [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) to compile the JavaScript and dependencies into a single file for distribution.

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates:
- `dist/index.js` - Main entry point
- `dist/post/index.js` - Post-action with all dependencies

**Important:** The `dist/` directory must be committed for the action to work in GitHub Actions.

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run tests and build before each commit.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
brew install pre-commit  # macOS
# or: pip install pre-commit  # other platforms

# Install the git hook scripts
pre-commit install
```

Now `npm test` and `npm run build` will run automatically before each commit. If either fails, the commit will be aborted.

**Manual execution:**

```bash
# Run hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```
